# Cows and Bulls Android App

This repository contains a minimal Android app skeleton for the Cows and Bulls game.

To build the app, open the project in Android Studio and sync the Gradle files.

The app now includes a dictionary of four-letter words located at
`app/src/main/res/raw/dictionary.txt`. When the app starts it loads this list
and displays the number of words available.
