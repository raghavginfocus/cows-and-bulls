# cows-and-bulls
Cows and Bulls Game is a classic word-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a 4-letter secret word chosen by the computer. For each guess, the game provides feedback in the form of "cows" (correct letters in the wrong position) and "bulls" (correct letters in the correct position). The game continues until the player guesses the word correctly, earning 4 bulls.

This project features:

Levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, based on word difficulty.

Dictionary-based: The game pulls words from an online dictionary and adjusts the level of difficulty accordingly.

Interactive: Allows players to input guesses, see history, and receive real-time feedback.

Play Again: Restart the game with a new word after a successful guess.

Feel free to fork the project, contribute, and improve the game!
